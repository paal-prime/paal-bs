Steiner Forest tests
====================

Tree tests
----------
Tree tests consist of a modified subset of SteinLib tests that are
avaiable at http://steinlib.zib.de


Forest tests
------------
Forest tests were generated by us.
Tests with "lp" prefix in their name were solved using linear programming by lp_solve program.
Names of other tests generated by us can be expressed as regular expression
[s | d][E | R]V<vertices count>K<terminal vertices count>. Letters 's', 'd' tells
whether the graph is sparse or dense and letters 'E', 'R' tells accordingly whether
the graph is Euclidean or if the edges were given random weight.
